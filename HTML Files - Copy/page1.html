                        <p><strong>In this page, our main focus are the age and gender variables. We will attempt to understand how gender influence the degree of injuries that occur in a accident, and the diffrences in injury rates and injury types among workers of diffrent ages.</strong></p>

                        <h3><strong>Variable 1: Gender</strong></h3>
                        <iframe width="1000" height="500" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://1drv.ms/x/s!Aki1ISozhh5UgropPwSPW67yxewkSQ?e=l4JmeL&action=embedview"></iframe>

                            Based on the provided data, the overall distribution of incidents heavily skews towards males, who account for approximately 89% of the total incidents, with 458 occurrences compared to females at 56. The data suggests that 'Burn' incidents are the most frequent for males, indicating a potential area for enhanced safety measures. 'Equipment' incidents are the most reported among females, which could warrant a review of safety protocols around equipment usage. The least common incident for males involves 'Vehicle', while for females, it is 'Fall'. Despite the gender imbalance, 'Equipment' and 'Crush & Pinch' show a relatively smaller disparity, suggesting these incident types affect both genders and might benefit from joint safety interventions. The high incidence of 'Burn', 'Cut', and 'Fall' across the board signals these as critical areas for targeted risk reduction strategies. The data underscores the importance of addressing specific hazards that are prevalent in male-dominated roles, while also tailoring safety measures to effectively protect female employees. Further investigation into the underlying causes of the gender disparity in incident rates could inform more equitable and effective health and safety policies.</p>

                            <iframe width="1000" height="500" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://1drv.ms/x/s!Aki1ISozhh5UgrospXmUik_W1ceWNg?e=lSqQ5R&action=embedview"></iframe>

                                The provided data table categorizes workplace incidents by age group, illustrating patterns that may inform workplace safety measures. The 25-34 age group reports the highest number of incidents (152), suggesting this demographic is either more at risk or more active in roles prone to incidents. Notably, 'Slip/trip' is the most common incident for this group, with 23 reported cases. 'Falling object' incidents peak in the 35-49 age group (16 cases), while the 18-24 age group sees the highest number of 'Equipment' related incidents (14 cases). The 'Cut' category is most prevalent among the 35-49 age group with 21 cases, possibly indicating a lack of experience or training in safety practices for handling sharp objects within this demographic. Conversely, the 50+ age group, while having fewer total incidents (118), shares the highest incidence of 'Burns' with the 18-24 group at 19 cases each, suggesting that age may not be a significant factor in these types of incidents. Overall, younger employees (18-24) are involved in fewer incidents (106), but the data does not account for workforce composition which could skew these figures. The total incidents reported across all age groups amount to 514, revealing a need for age-tailored safety protocols, particularly focused on the most affected age groups and incident types to enhance workplace safety effectively.</p>
